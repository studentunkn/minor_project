how to declartion variables

```txt
[delclarion command] [variable name] = [variable];
```

-`example`
```C
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
int a = 5;
char b = 'H';
float c = 3.14;
double d = 2.71;
}
```

If you want to make word as a variable you should us ""(double quotaions);
If you want to make letter as a variable you should us ''(single quotaions);
